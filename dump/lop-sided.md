> Yet neither did Merleau-Ponty seek a solution, as did Pierre Thevanez, in an "object-centered" ontology of the *Lebenswelt*. That proposal would slant and reduce our lived-experience in the opposite, **lop-sided** direction. Merleau-Ponty reckoned that if Husserl's philosophy of consciousness "flew us over" the world of lived-experience, then an equally **lop-sided** "object-centered" analysis would "dig us under" the Lebenswelt, for which philosophy is ultimately responsible to give adequate account. Besides, the "object-centered" approach would only add to the reductionist scientism of the naturalistic programs that Husserl also legitimately wished to avoid.

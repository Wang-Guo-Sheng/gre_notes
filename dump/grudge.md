怨恨，吝啬

###
A variant of [[grutch]] (mid 15th-century, younger than [[begrudge]]), from Middle English grucchen (“to murmur, complain, feel envy, begrudge”), from Old French grouchier, groucier (“to murmur, [[grumble]]”), of Germanic origin, akin to Middle High German grogezen (“to howl, wail”), German grocken (“to croak”). Compare also Old Norse krytja (“to murmur”), Old High German grunzen (“to [[grunt]]”).

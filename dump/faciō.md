Latin.
Etymology[edit]
From Proto-Italic *fakjō, from Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁- (“to put, place, set”), possibly through a later intermediate root *dʰh₁-k-yé/ó-. Cognates include Ancient Greek τίθημι (títhēmi), Sanskrit दधाति (dádhāti), Old English dōn (English [[do]]) and Lithuanian dėti (“to put”).

The passive voice is suppletively provided by the unrelated verb fīō (“I become, I am made”).

faciō (present infinitive facere, perfect active fēcī, supine factum); third conjugation iō-variant, irregular passive voice

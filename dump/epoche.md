Alternative forms: [[epoché]]

Etymology:
Epoché (ἐποχή epokhē, "cessation") is an ancient Greek term. In Hellenistic philosophy it is a technical term typically translated as "[[suspension]] of judgment" but also as "[[withhold|withholding]] of [[assent]]". In the modern philosophy of Phenomenology it refers to a process of setting aside assumptions and beliefs.
This term was introduced by **Husserl** and other phenomenologists, although it also seems to be present in Aristotelian philosophy (as the concept did originate with Aristotle).

Noun
- Moment of theoretical suspension of all action.
- Moment of theoretical suspension of [[disbelief]].

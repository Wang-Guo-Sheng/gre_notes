> dovetail (verb): fit together tightly, as if by means of a interlocking joint 
Although Darwin's evolution and Mendel's genetics were developed in isolation from one another, they dovetail each other very well. 
This word has other definitions but this is the most important one for the GRE 


- a joint formed by one or more tapered projections (tenons) on one piece which interlock with corresponding notches or recesses (mortises) in another. 榫卯
- join together by means of a dovetail.

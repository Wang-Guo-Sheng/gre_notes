> exegesis (noun): [[critical]] [[explanation]] or [[analysis]], especially of a text 
The Bible is fertile ground for exegesis--over the past five centuries there have been as many interpretations as there are pages in the Old Testament. 

###
Borrowed from Ancient Greek ἐξήγησις (exḗgēsis, “interpretation”), from ἐξηγέομαι (exēgéomai, “I explain, interpret”), from ἐξ (ex, “out”) + [[ἡγέομαι]] (hēgéomai, “I lead, guide”).

###
A critical explanation or interpretation of a text, especially a religious text.

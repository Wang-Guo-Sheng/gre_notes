> maxim (noun): a short saying expressing a general truth 
Johnson initially suggests that the secret to business can be summarized in a single maxim but then requires a 300-page book to explain exactly what he means. 

> Alain said to his students: Truth is momentary for us men who have a short view. It belongs to a situation, to an instant; it is necessary to see it, to say it, to do it at this very moment, not before nor after in ridiculous **maxims**; not for many times, for there are no many times.

quandary (noun): state of uncertainty or perplexity especially as requiring a choice between equally 
unfavorable options 
Steve certainly is in a quandary: if he doesn't call Elaine, she will blame him for everything, but if he does 
call her, the evidence of where he currently is could cost him his job.

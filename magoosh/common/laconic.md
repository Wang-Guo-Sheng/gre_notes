简短，简明
(of a person, speech, or style of writing) using very few words.

> laconic (adjective): one who says very few words 
While Martha always swooned over the hunky, laconic types in romantic comedies, her boyfriends inevitably were very talkative--and not very hunky. 


From Latin Lacōnicus (“Spartan”), from Ancient Greek Λακωνικός (Lakōnikós, “Laconian”). [[Laconia]] was the region inhabited and ruled by the Spartans, who were known for their brevity in speech.

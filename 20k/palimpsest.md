palimpsest (noun): something that has been changed numerous times but on which traces of former 
iterations can still be seen 
The downtown was a palimpsest of the city's checkered past: a new Starbucks had opened up next to an 
abandoned, shuttered building, and a freshly asphalted road was inches away from a pothole large 
enough to swallow a small dog.
